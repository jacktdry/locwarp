# LocWarp

**A Windows tool that controls the GPS location of an iPhone or iPad.** No jailbreak. Works over USB or Wi-Fi, with Teleport, Navigate, Multi-point Route, Flower Farmer circling, Random Walk, and Joystick modes, and can drive up to three devices at once.

This fork also includes a macOS USB/packaging port for Apple Silicon and Intel.
See [macOS setup, development, release steps and limitations](docs/MACOS.md).
macOS Wi-Fi and real-device acceptance are not yet complete; desktop location uses coarse IP positioning.

## Quick start

1. Download the latest `LocWarp Setup x.y.z.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/keezxc1223/locwarp/releases) and install it.
2. Install iTunes or Apple Devices on the PC. Either one provides the Apple USB driver.
3. Connect the iPhone over USB and tap "Trust This Computer" on the phone.
4. On the iPhone, turn on Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode. If the option is missing, connect in LocWarp and press "Enable Developer Mode" in its Settings tab to make it appear.
5. Launch LocWarp (it asks for administrator rights) and right-click the map to teleport.

Each step is covered in detail under [Installation and setup](#installation-and-setup). If your antivirus quarantines the backend program, add the install folder to its exclusion list and reinstall.

## Requirements and compatibility

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| PC | Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit) |
| Device | iPhone / iPad. **iOS / iPadOS 17 and later** is the primary supported range |
| iOS 16.x | Community maintained (@bitifyChen, [#9](https://github.com/keezxc1223/locwarp/pull/9)), using the LegacyLocationService path |
| iOS 15 and earlier | Not supported |
| Connection | USB cable, or the same Wi-Fi subnet (Wi-Fi Tunnel is iOS 17+ only) |

### Versions reported working

| Major | Verified versions |
| --- | --- |
| **iOS 27.x** | 27.0 (tested by the developer on iPhone 18 Pro Max) |
| **iOS 26.x** | 26.5 · 26.4.2 · 26.4.1 · 26.4.1 iPadOS · 26.4 · 26.3.1 · 26.2 · 26.2.1 iPadOS (M1 iPad) |
| **iOS 18.x** | 18.7.8 · 18.7.7 · 18.7.1 · 18.6.2 · 18.5 iPadOS · 18.3.1 · 18.1.1 |
| **iOS 17.x** | 17.6.1 |
| **iOS 16.x** (community) | 16.7.15 · 16.7.12 |

"Reported working" means **at least one user ran it successfully in their own environment**. It is not a general compatibility guarantee. Stability depends on the iOS patch version, pymobiledevice3 support for that version, whether the Developer Disk Image is mounted, and the drivers, VPN, firewall, and antivirus setup on the Windows side. An iOS 16+ version missing from the table simply has no report yet. Reports are welcome in [Issues](https://github.com/keezxc1223/locwarp/issues).

## Features

### Movement modes

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Teleport** | Jump straight to a coordinate |
| **Navigate** | Travel along real roads at walking, cycling, or driving speed from the current position to a destination |
| **Multi-point Route** | Visit waypoints in order, optionally pausing at each stop (random 5 to 20 seconds by default). Laps: 0 runs the route once, N runs N laps, blank loops forever |
| **Flower Farmer** | Circle around each waypoint. Radius, segments per circle (3 to 20), circles per point (0.5 is a half circle), total rounds, and the wait before and after each point are all adjustable and saved. Travel between points by walking or teleporting. The panel shows a live estimate of the total run time, and a dropped connection reconnects and resumes on its own |
| **Random Walk** | Wander randomly inside a radius, with adjustable pauses between legs |
| **Joystick** | Steer live by direction and intensity. WASD and arrow keys are supported |

Multi-point Route has a **point-to-point jump** option that teleports from waypoint to waypoint instead of following roads, for cases where the GPS only needs to sit at each point in turn. The delay before each jump (default 2 seconds) and after it (default 4 seconds) are adjustable, and both freeze while paused.

### Speed control

- Three presets: walking 10.8, cycling 19.8, driving 60 km/h.
- Enter any fixed speed, or a min to max range (for example 40 to 80 km/h) that is re-rolled for every leg to mimic real traffic.
- Change the speed while moving and press "Apply new speed". Movement continues from the current position at the new speed, with no restart.
- The last speed you picked is remembered for the next launch. A countdown banner appears above the map while paused at a stop.

### Routing source

The road routes used by Navigate and Multi-point Route can come from any of four free, no-signup routing engines:

| Engine | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **OSRM public demo** (default) | Global coverage, occasionally goes down entirely |
| **OSRM FOSSGIS** | The same OSRM engine on a mirror hosted by FOSSGIS |
| **Valhalla** | A completely different engine, most useful when both OSRM nodes are down |
| **BRouter** | An independently run fourth engine with cycling, hiking, and driving profiles |

When an engine fails, that leg falls back to a straight line and the next leg tries the engine again, so a run never stalls. You can also tick "Use straight-line path" to skip the engines altogether. Multi-point Route has an "optimal order" button that finds the shortest visiting order.

### Connection

- **USB**: connects automatically when plugged in, and locking the iPhone screen has no effect. Unplugging is detected within about 4 seconds, and plugging back in recovers without a refresh.
- **Wi-Fi Tunnel** (iOS 17+, requires one prior USB pairing):
  - "Auto-detect" looks for the device over mDNS first, then scans the local network.
  - Previously used IPs are remembered. You can also pin a device so that it connects on every launch and retries after a drop.
  - "Keep connection alive when the screen dims" (experimental) keeps re-sending the position to reduce drops after the iPhone locks.
  - "Re-pair" rebuilds a damaged pairing record over USB in one click.
  - Stopping the tunnel while USB is still plugged in switches back to USB automatically.

### Multi-device group mode

Connect **up to three** devices at once. Teleport, Navigate, every movement mode, pause, resume, stop, apply speed, and restore are sent to all devices together, from both the desktop UI and the phone web control.

- Before any action starts, all devices are teleported to the same coordinate so their paths match.
- Random Walk shares one random seed, so every device walks the same route.
- A device plugged in later syncs to the current position and joins the task already running.
- Each device can be restored, disconnected, or have its Developer Mode option revealed on its own.

### Map

- **Layer switcher** (top right): OSM, Google Tiles (Beta), ESRI Street Map, ESRI Satellite, OpenFreeMap Liberty / Bright / Positron (vector), VersaTiles Colorful, NLSC (Taiwan), GSI (Japan). None of them need an API key.
- Waypoints are labelled S / 1 / 2 / 3, and the route line has flowing arrows that show direction.
- The top-left button recentres the map on the current simulated position. In "show route only" view the map zooms to fit the whole route.
- The map marker can be swapped for one of six built-in characters or your own PNG (transparent borders are trimmed automatically).
- Coordinates can be shown as DD, DMS, or DM.

### Saved coordinates

- New entries pick up a place name and a country flag automatically, and the flag refreshes when the coordinates are edited.
- Categories with custom colours, plus search, sorting (name / date / last used), drag-and-drop ordering, and multi-select delete.
- Import and export: JSON (everything, imports merge rather than overwrite) and GPX (a single entry, a whole category, or several categories as one ZIP).
- Show every saved coordinate on the map. Tens of thousands stay smooth, and dense areas cluster automatically.
- "Click also moves GPS" decides whether clicking an entry actually teleports there or only pans the map for a look.

### Saved routes

- Routes can be categorised, reordered by dragging, and started straight from the list.
- GPX and JSON import and export.
- Copy the waypoints in their current order as `lat, lng` text, one per line.

### Address search

- **Free**: the default provider, built on OpenStreetMap open data, no API key needed. A Photon option in the settings offers stronger fuzzy matching and typo tolerance.
- **Google Geocoding**: enter your own API key (stored only on your machine) for the most accurate results on Chinese place names and businesses. There is a free monthly quota.
- The coordinate box accepts pasted coordinate text and picks out the valid latitude and longitude.
- The phone web control follows the provider chosen on the desktop.

### Phone web control

Control LocWarp from a phone browser when you are away from the PC. The "Phone control" button in the status bar shows a LAN address and a 6-digit PIN. Enter them on the phone to get a mobile map with teleport, navigate to a point (walk / bike / drive or a custom speed), address search, coordinate input, stop, and restore, plus a live view of the route running on the desktop.

> The phone must be on the **same Wi-Fi** as the PC, and the PC firewall must allow port 8777. "Regenerate" issues a new PIN at once and invalidates phones paired earlier.

### Status bar

- **Country flag, place name, local weather, and temperature** for the current simulated position.
- A time difference indicator after crossing time zones. Click it for full time zone details.
- **Restore**: clears the simulated location. Note that "Stop" only ends the movement and keeps the simulated location in place. Press Restore to return to the real GPS.
- Version number, with a `NEW` badge when an update is available. Click it to open the download page.
- "Log folder" button: opens `~/.locwarp/logs/` so you can attach backend.log to an issue.

### Other

- **Cooldown**: a cooldown based on teleport distance, to lower the risk of being flagged for impossible movement.
- The interface switches between Traditional Chinese and English on the fly.
- Route completion sound, and a hardware acceleration switch (turning it off fixes ghosting or a black window on some GPU drivers, see [Issue #24](https://github.com/keezxc1223/locwarp/issues/24)).
- All data (saved coordinates, routes, settings) lives in `~/.locwarp/` and survives a reinstall.

## Installation and setup

**[Download the installer](https://github.com/keezxc1223/locwarp/releases)**. It bundles everything, so there is no need to install Python or Node. After installing, launch **LocWarp** from the desktop or Start menu. It asks for administrator rights, which the Wi-Fi Tunnel needs in order to create a virtual network interface.

### 1. Install the Apple USB driver

Windows needs Apple's USB driver to talk to an iPhone. Install **any one** of these:

- [iTunes for Windows (desktop, 64-bit)](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/itunes12/047-76416-20260302-fefe4356-211d-4da1-8bc4-058eb36ea803/iTunes64Setup.exe)
- [iTunes from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pb2mz1zmb1s)
- [Apple Devices from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9np83lwlpz9k)

Desktop iTunes works for most people. If iTunes cannot see the iPhone, users have reported that Apple Devices does.

### 2. Connect over USB and trust the computer

Before first use, connect the iPhone with a USB cable. The phone asks "Trust This Computer?". Tap **Trust** and enter your passcode.

### 3. Turn on Developer Mode

On the iPhone: **Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode → On**. The device asks to restart, then asks you to confirm once more.

On iOS 16 and later this option is hidden by default. Once LocWarp is connected, open the **Settings** tab at the top and press "**Enable Developer Mode**". After pressing it:

1. Fully close the Settings app on the iPhone.
2. Reopen Settings → Privacy & Security and scroll down to find Developer Mode.
3. Turn it on and restart when asked.

If the button does not work (for example on a Wi-Fi only connection), use the [IPA sideloading fallback](#appendix-revealing-developer-mode-by-sideloading).

### 4. Mount the Developer Disk Image (iOS 17+)

iOS 17 and later need a Personalized DDI mounted on the iPhone before the location can be simulated. LocWarp only checks for it and never downloads or mounts it. If you see "No DDI detected on the iPhone", mount it once with any of these tools: Xcode, i4Tools, 3uTools, or the pymobiledevice3 CLI.

### 5. Wi-Fi Tunnel (optional)

To unplug USB and go wireless:

- The iPhone and the PC must be on the **same Wi-Fi subnet**.
- The USB pairing from step 2 must already be done.
- Start the Wi-Fi Tunnel from the Connection tab in LocWarp. Once it is up, USB can be unplugged.

| Connection | iPhone screen lock | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **USB** | No effect | None |
| **Wi-Fi Tunnel** | Puts the network interface to sleep and drops the connection | Turn off Auto-Lock, or enable "Keep connection alive when the screen dims" |

With the Wi-Fi Tunnel, set Settings → Display & Brightness → Auto-Lock to **Never** and keep the phone on a charger.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| A dialog says the backend program is missing | Antivirus quarantined the unsigned backend exe. Add the install folder to the exclusion list and reinstall |
| The tunnel starts but nothing connects | Make sure LocWarp runs as administrator, and try again with VPN or third-party firewall software turned off |
| Wi-Fi auto-detect finds no device | Check that both are on the same Wi-Fi subnet and that the router has no client or AP isolation. Entering the IP by hand also works |
| `No such service: com.apple.instruments.dtservicehub`, or "No DDI detected" | Mount the DDI as described in [step 4](#4-mount-the-developer-disk-image-ios-17). If it still fails, turn Developer Mode off, reboot, turn it back on, and mount again |
| Developer Mode is missing from the iPhone Settings | With the device connected, open the Settings tab at the top of LocWarp and press "Enable Developer Mode", then close and reopen the iPhone Settings app as described in [step 3](#3-turn-on-developer-mode). If the button does not work, use the [sideloading fallback](#appendix-revealing-developer-mode-by-sideloading) |
| Ghosting or a black window | Turn off hardware acceleration in the Settings tab |
| App crashes right at launch | Newer builds fall back to software rendering and relaunch on their own; if it still crashes, right-click the shortcut › Properties › Target and append `--no-sandbox --disable-gpu --in-process-gpu` |
| The flag or place name does not appear | Both come from free public services that are sometimes briefly unresponsive. Teleport again a little later |

When reporting a problem, include the iOS version, the connection type, and `~/.locwarp/logs/backend.log`.

### Appendix: Revealing Developer Mode by sideloading

1. Install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/).
2. Get any IPA from [Decrypt IPA Store](https://decrypt.day/) or [ARM Converter Decrypted App Store](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us). A small one keeps the sideload short.
3. Drag the IPA into Sideloadly, connect the iPhone over USB, enter your personal Apple ID, and press **Start**.
4. When it finishes, Developer Mode appears at the bottom of Settings → Privacy & Security. Turn it on and restart.

All icons are inline SVG and the styling is a single hand-written `styles.css`. No third-party icon or UI kit is used.

### External services

All free. Only Google Geocoding needs a key, which the user supplies. Nothing else needs a signup.

| Service | Called from | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [OSRM demo](https://project-osrm.org/), [OSRM FOSSGIS](https://routing.openstreetmap.de/), [Valhalla](https://valhalla1.openstreetmap.de/), [BRouter](https://brouter.de/) | backend | Routing and waypoint order optimisation |
| [Photon (komoot)](https://photon.komoot.io/) | backend | Address search and reverse geocoding (flag, place name) |
| [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding) | backend | Address search (optional, user-supplied key) |
| [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) | frontend | Weather at the simulated position |
| [TimezoneDB](https://timezonedb.com/) | backend | Coordinate to time zone (built-in key) |
| [flagcdn.com](https://flagcdn.com/) | frontend | Flag images |
| OpenStreetMap, Google, [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/), [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/), [VersaTiles](https://versatiles.org/), [NLSC](https://maps.nlsc.gov.tw/), [GSI](https://www.gsi.go.jp/) | frontend | Map tiles |
| [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/keezxc1223/locwarp/releases) | frontend | Update check at launch (no telemetry) |

Reverse geocoding does not use the public Nominatim server. Its usage policy counts traffic per application, which does not suit a distributed desktop app. If the default address search option is refused by Nominatim, it falls back to Photon automatically.

### Core modules (`backend/core/`)

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `simulation_engine.py` | Central controller: state transitions, task lifecycle, the `_move_along_route()` movement loop, ETA tracking |
| `device_manager.py` | Device discovery, USB and Wi-Fi Tunnel connection management |
| `navigator.py` | Single-destination navigation |
| `route_loop.py` / `multi_stop.py` | Looping and stopping for Multi-point Route |
| `flower.py` | Circling logic for Flower Farmer |
| `random_walk.py` / `joystick.py` | Random Walk, Joystick |
| `teleport.py` / `restore.py` | Teleport, restore |

### Design notes

- **Position push**: the backend emits `position_update` over WebSocket on every tick, and the frontend updates the map and ETA live.
- **Speed resolution**: `config.resolve_speed_profile()` handles mode preset, fixed speed, and random range in one place, with priority range > fixed > preset.
- **In-process Wi-Fi tunnel**: the backend runs `start_tcp_tunnel()` inside its main event loop. There is no separate helper process.
- **State directory**: all runtime data goes to `~/.locwarp/`, avoiding PyInstaller's temporary directory.
- **Restrained geo lookups**: flag, place name, time zone, and weather are looked up only while idle or after a teleport, and only after moving more than 100 m. Nothing is looked up during movement, so it never competes with device traffic. The four lookups run in parallel, so one slow service does not hold up the rest.
- **Reverse geocode cache**: results are stored on disk per cell of roughly 100 m (`reverse_geocode_cache.json`, kept 30 days). Returning to a place already looked up costs no request, and identical lookups fired at the same moment share one request. Adding a coordinate and "What's here" bypass the cache to get an exact name.
- **Weather straight from the frontend**: each user spends their own Open-Meteo quota by IP rather than going through the backend.
- **Layer preconnect**: hovering the layer picker opens connections to every layer's host and fetches the vector styles, which shortens the wait on the first switch.
- **Multi-device group**: the primary device is never displaced by one plugged in later. The newcomer syncs to the primary's position and joins its task.

### Development setup

Requirements: Windows 10 / 11, Python **3.13**, Node.js 18+, and an iPhone that is paired with Developer Mode on.

```bash
# Backend dependencies (including the Wi-Fi tunnel)
py -3.13 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
```

Double-clicking `LocWarp.bat` elevates itself and starts the backend (`:8777`) and the Vite dev server (`:5173`), then opens the default browser. To start things by hand:

```bash
# Terminal 1: backend
cd backend && py -3.13 main.py

# Terminal 2a: frontend in the browser
cd frontend && npx vite --host --port 5173

# Terminal 2b: frontend in an Electron window (same as the installed app)
cd frontend && npm run start
```

> Dev mode runs on `http://` and the installed app on `file://`, and the two do not behave identically (the MapLibre worker, for one). After upgrading frontend dependencies, always verify with a packaged installer.

### Building the installer

```bash
# One-time setup
py -3.13 -m pip install pyinstaller
cd frontend && npm install -D electron-builder

# One-shot build
build-installer.bat
```

`build-installer.bat` runs, in order:

1. **PyInstaller** builds the backend into `dist-py/locwarp-backend/`
2. **Vite** builds the frontend into `frontend/dist/`
3. **electron-builder** produces `frontend/release/LocWarp Setup X.Y.Z.exe` (about 175 MB)

Note that `npm run dist` only runs step 3. Re-run PyInstaller after changing the backend, and re-run `npx vite build` after changing the frontend or the version number. Otherwise the installer ships stale content.

Using it with location-based games (such as Pokémon GO, Ingress, or Monster Hunter Now) or with social, check-in, or logistics apps may violate those platforms' terms of service and lead to warnings, restrictions, suspension, or a permanent ban. **The developer accepts no responsibility for any account loss, virtual property damage, or resulting dispute.**

### 3. System and hardware risk

In Wi-Fi Tunnel mode this project must run with **administrator rights** to create a TUN virtual network interface and negotiate an RSD (Remote Service Discovery) channel with the iOS device. The code has been tested internally, but the developer does not guarantee stable operation on every Windows version, hardware combination, or network. Known possibilities include:

- Conflicts with VPN software, third-party firewalls, or network virtualisation tools that stop the tunnel from forming or briefly disrupt networking
- A leftover TUN interface after an abnormal exit that needs a reboot to clear
- Having to retry by hand or restart the app after a dropped connection

You are responsible for weighing these risks and for any consequences. The project only touches the temporary network interface it creates and its own settings under `~/.locwarp/`. **It does not modify any user data on the iOS device, and does not change operating system files or existing device pairing records.**

### 4. Map data accuracy

The frontend uses Leaflet with base maps from OpenStreetMap and other third-party tile providers. Routing uses the public OSRM, Valhalla, and BRouter services, and geocoding uses public services such as Photon. Coordinates, routes, and addresses shown on the map are **for reference only**. The developer does not guarantee that they are complete, current, correct, or an exact match for real-world geography. Before relying on address search, navigation, or random walk results for a simulation, check that what the map shows is what you expect.

### 5. User responsibility

You are responsible for complying with the laws and regulations where you live, including but not limited to personal data protection law, copyright law, and applicable international treaties. Any legal dispute, civil liability, or criminal liability arising from abuse, misuse, or unlawful use of this tool rests with the user alone and does not involve the developers or contributors of this project.
